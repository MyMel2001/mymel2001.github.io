                <p>
        I have chosen to step away from most of my online presence because I needed to
        protect my privacy and mental well‑being. The constant feeling that I was being
        watched made everyday browsing feel like an invasion, and the anxiety grew
        overwhelming. I realized I could no longer ignore the impact this had on my
        ability to think clearly and live in the moment.
    </p>

    <p>
        The final straw came when I detected suspicious activity from someone who called
        themselves a "friend." Up until then, I trusted this person quite a bit, but then they acted like a
        fed – somehow having my personal info and some sort of "list."" I felt "sused out"
        – the term I use for being so deeply unsettled that I could no longer stay
        connected to the platforms they could probe. Their betrayal (real or not) confirmed that I could
        not safely continue sharing my life online.
    </p>

    <p>
        Consequently, I quit most forms of social media and web content, shutting down the
        majority of my own sites. I kept only Free and Open‑Source Software (FOSS) services
        that I could control and trust. I still rely on a few proprietary services, but I’m
        not disclosing which ones. Even with those safeguards, I remain scared,
        confused, and paranoid. The realization that people I considered friends could
        betray me has left me wary of forming new online relationships.
    </p>

    <p>
        I want to acknowledge one person in particular: "Void." You were a true friend (that is, 
        if the whole glowie thing was a joke - albeit a real bad one.), and I am genuinely 
        sorry that I had to leave so abruptly. I hope you understand that my disappearance was 
        not a reflection of our friendship, but a necessary step for my safety and peace of mind.
