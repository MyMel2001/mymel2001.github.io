                    <h1>Why I Decided to Mostly Disappear from the Internet</h1>

    <p>
        I have chosen to step away from most of my online presence because I needed to
        protect my privacy and mental well‑being. The constant feeling that I was being
        watched made everyday browsing feel like an invasion, and the anxiety grew
        overwhelming. I realized I could no longer ignore the impact this had on my
        ability to think clearly and live in the moment.
    </p>

    <p>
        Over time I became a bit addicted to social media – chasing cred points such as
        likes, direct messages, and re‑posts. Each notification delivered a tiny surge
        of dopamine, creating a feedback loop that kept me scrolling, posting, and
        checking for the next hit. The constant stream of validation felt exhilarating at
        first, but soon I recognized it was eroding my focus, mood, and sense of self.
        I decided it wasn’t healthy to let my wellbeing be dictated by an endless
        pursuit of virtual approval, so I chose to step back a bit.
    </p>

    <p>
        Consequently, I quit most forms of social media and web content, shutting down the
        majority of my own sites. I kept only Free and Open‑Source Software (FOSS) services
        that I could control and trust. I still rely on a few proprietary services, but I’m
        not disclosing which ones. Even with those safeguards, I remain scared,
        confused, and paranoid. The realization that people I considered friends could
        betray me has left me wary of forming new online relationships.
