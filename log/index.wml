The resulting antitrust case was just a minor inconvenience for a company so dedicated to "fair competition."</p><h3> Windows ME & Vista: Monuments to Quality</h3><p>Who could forget the stability and reliability of Windows ME? Or the streamlined, resource-efficient Windows Vista? These operating systems were so "ahead of their time" that users couldn't wait to upgrade... to literally anything else. Blue screens of death became Microsoft's unofficial logo during these eras.</p><h3> Embrace, Extend, Extinguish</h3><p>Microsoft's famous "Embrace, Extend, Extinguish" business strategy deserves special recognition. Step 1: Adopt a popular standard. Step 2: Add proprietary extensions. Step 3: Use those extensions to eliminate competition. It's like watching a python slowly digesting its prey – fascinating in a horrifying way.</p><h3> Windows 10: Free* Operating System</h3><p>(*Privacy sold separately)</p><p>Windows 10 brought us the joy of forced updates at inconvenient times and telemetry that sent so much user data back to Microsoft that NSA agents were probably taking notes. Nothing says "customer first" like treating user privacy as an optional extra!</p><h3> Microsoft Office: Holding Documents Hostage</h3><p>For decades, Microsoft Office has been the gold standard in proprietary formats designed to ensure no other software can properly open your documents. Why promote open standards when you can lock users into your ecosystem forever?</p><h3> Xbox: Where Online Gaming Isn't Free</h3><p>Remember when online gaming was free? Microsoft decided that was a terrible idea and pioneered charging for the privilege of using your own internet connection to play games you already purchased. Genius!</p><h3> Internet Explorer 6: Web Development Hell</h3><p>Microsoft gifted web developers worldwide with Internet Explorer 6, which stubbornly refused to follow web standards and required countless workarounds. They single-handedly held back web innovation for years. Thanks for that decade of extra work, Microsoft!</p><h3> Conclusion: Here's to 50 More?</h3><p>So here's to you, Microsoft, on your 50th anniversary. From aggressive monopolistic practices to privacy-invading operating systems, from intentionally incompatible file formats to forced obsolescence – you've truly left your mark on the computing world.</p><p>As I type this on my Mac mini while my Linux server hums quietly in the background, I can't help but feel a sense of gratitude... gratitude that alternatives exist to your "innovations."</p><p>Happy Birthday, Microsoft! May your next 50 years be exactly what you deserve.</p><p>*Sent from my Mac*</p><p> </p><p> </p><h2> Wed Apr 16 01:02:59 AM UTC 2025 - Opinion: Bryan Lunduke's Right-Wing Agenda Overpowers Factuality (aka: The Tea on Lunduke: A Cautionary Tale of Unchecked Opinions)</h2><p>***Vibe written by Sammy Lord and LLAMA 3.2 technology - although I made sure my message came across.***</p><h3> Lunduke's Brand of Truth-Telling: More Like TexJoy than Steak</h3><p>Bryan Lunduke, the infamous tech journalist, has been making waves with his recent forays into the world of right-wing politics. While he claims to be looking for "tea" on the left, it's clear that his motivations are far from altruistic. Instead, he appears to be using his platform to spread a right-wing agenda, masking it behind a veneer of factuality.</p><p>Lunduke's approach is emblematic of a broader problem in tech journalism: the blurring of lines between opinion and fact. Rather than presenting nuanced analysis or thoughtful commentary, Lunduke seems content to spoon-feed readers a heavy dose of his own opinion, seasoning it with a liberal sprinkling of right-wing talking points. The result is a narrative that feels more like a TexJoy-fueled smorgasbord than a steak dinner of substance.</p><h3> A Love for Tech, Lost in the Sauce</h3><p>Make no mistake, Lunduke and I share a passion for tech – old and new, both of which are dear to my heart. However, it's clear that our opinions on everything else have grown further apart with each passing year. What was once a shared enthusiasm has given way to a deep-seated frustration with Lunduke's increasing right-wing leanings.</p><p>It's no secret that Lunduke's views have shifted significantly in recent years, and while I respect the fact that individuals are entitled to hold their own opinions, his behavior has become increasingly erratic. The man who once brought us insightful analysis and thoughtful commentary now peddles a brand of right-wing ideology that feels more like a thinly veiled attempt to proselytize than a genuine call for discussion.</p><h3> Meritocracy vs. Excess</h3><p>As someone who has long been skeptical of DEI initiatives, I understand the desire for a meritocratic society where individuals are judged on their merits alone. However, I firmly believe that leaking sensitive information about DEI in a way that mirrors the Snowden revelations is excessive and counterproductive.</p><p>IF we were in a true meritocracy like Lunduke wants, AI would be taking jobs rather than helping humans with their jobs. And that’s not what you guys want, is it? We have to make a living somehow, we haven’t figured out that “everything can be free” thing yet after all!</p><h3> Conclusion</h3><p>Bryan Lunduke's recent forays into right-wing politics have been a recipe for disaster. His brand of truth-telling is more akin to TexJoy than steak – a heavy-handed attempt to impose his opinions on readers without regard for nuance or factuality.</p><p>As we move forward, it's essential that we prioritize substance over sensationalism and fact-checking over ideology. Only then can we hope to create a more inclusive, equitable society where everyone has the opportunity to thrive.</p><p>---</p><p>Note: The views expressed in this above post are those of the author alone and do not necessarily reflect any official stance or position on this Capitan's Log.</p><p>---</p><p> </p><p> </p><h2> Wed Apr 16 04:02:00 AM UTC 2025 - Archive of what I commented about Lunduke on YT and replies</h2><h3> Me:</h3><p>Good lord, lunduke! You have officially gone off the rails of the crazy train! I used to respect you, but I can no longer see any respect due to your recent actions. I am sorry, but I will have to politely unsubscribe. Thanks for your understanding.</p><p>--SL, from Sneed Group.</p><h3> Reply 1:</h3><h3># xgui4-stuudio:</h3><p>what did he did or am i just stupid and this is sarcasm or just bait ?</p><h3># Me:</h3><p>@xgui4-studio  Offensive stuff, such as calling trans women "a man who think he's a woman" and now he's asking for, as the kids would probably put it, "tea" on the left-wing. He claims to want to "tell the truth" but honestly wants to just spread the right-wing party, which in hindsight I should have seen long ago because for the past few years he's been inserting his politics into these videos. There is much more tech news than what Lunduke reports, but he claims to be the only source of the truth because it's the truth with his opinion seasoning it. Like not just a light sprinkle of seasoning, but more like a huge pile of figurative TexJoy that is his opinion/politics overpowering the steak that is the small kernel of truth type of thing. Hell sometimes it's all "TexJoy," no "steak" and he's trying to present it as "steak." No wonder other tech journalists don't want to touch this guy with a 10 foot pole. It's getting a bit long in the tooth.</p><p>Lunduke and I might share a love for tech, both old and new (mostly old), but we have no similarites anymore besides that. It's more like I have had it with his crud because my opinions and views have changed and for the past few years so has his - at least quite a bit, enough to come out as a right-wing nutjob. I hope you understand.</p><p>PS: I hate DEI too, I would love for the world to be a bit of a meritocracy again, but IMO leaking this info to the public similar to the Snowden revelations is kinda.... "excessive." Besides, if the world was a meritocracy truly, AI would be taking all the jobs faster than they are now.</p><h3> Reply 2:</h3><h3># KentuckyFan8181:</h3><p>What are you on about. What did he even say or do. I been watching for months.</p><h3># Me:</h3><p>@KentuckyFan8181  Just got notification about this convo, decided to put a small rant as reply to xgui4. BTW: Not bait. Being 100% real.</p><h3> Reply 3:</h3><h3># Manstrual:</h3><p>@OnioNode  have you watched his video with Chris Titus</p><h3># Me:</h3><p>​</p><p>@Manstrual  Yes. If I recall correctly Chris Titus is a centrist, which while I find politics fine in the right time or place (which is almost never, especially not in public - but i'll go ahead and do what Lunduke does because I'm his guest in his comment), at least HIS videos don't contain as many political opinions sprinkled in as Lunduke's does if any at all. And tech content, let's be honest, isn't the right time or place to be talking politics. Also, the leaks are a null and mute point because, as I said, leaking "woke" stuff going on in the tech world is just a little extreme for what it is - people with different political stances than his. Now is it a stance that is kinda maddening they're expressing? Yes, but Lunduke is supporting a person who is sending immigrants to camps - and that person even wants to do so with everyday american citizens - not to mention the anti-lgbt stuff and facist ideas and the like that orange man who shalt be named supports. Yall really have to bury your heads in the sand to not notice this stuff. Not to menton that the orange man said during his campaign for 2024 elections that voting will be fixed, and elon "sending his heart out" - possibly to/for a certain artist man with a tiny moustache and a knack for killing people. I'm telling you guys, Trump is the next moustache man - except when it comes to the origin country it's USA and not Germany. Trump made a team to do huge budget cuts. Trump did tarrifs on china, which lunduke posted a video on his support due to making people go to other countries to manufacture their products, ignoring the fact that they'll just go to other third-world countries and history will repeat itself. This is because Trump wants everything in America made in Amercia - and moustache man wanted everything in Germany made in Germany. I'm telling you history is repeating itself - the signs are everywhere, you are just burrying your heads in the sand as prices go up and stock market goes down and all with Trump slowly turning into moustache man and Lunduke cheering him on while covering "news" that fits the agenda and stating that as pure fact - all while sneaking in his politics. This, I believe, is what most people think of when they say Lunduke is a "facist." I believe they are speaking quite figuratively and not literally. He doesn't really like moustache man, just someone who reflects a ton of his actions into his own.</p><p>TLDR - i heavily dislike right-wing people who ignore the facts and spread their agneda while pretending they are covering the non-opinionated truth, Lunduke is just one of many.</p><h3> Final reply.</h3><h3># Me:</h3><p>I'll be leaving this comment section be.

I blame WD. That is why I had to backup the Minecraft server/SneedGit and ultimately install a new Seagate HDD and install a new Ubuntu Server install, resetting everything except what few things backed up OK.</p><p>This sadly also means some of the data that I backed up is likely corrupted, and also means S Social is down forever due to limitations of Misskey and the fact the SQL DB was already corrupted. Therefore, I shall return to SKRT. Also sChan wasn't transfered completely so I had to do a reset.</p><p>Good news though: Most of the stuff I had was either open sourced by myself/others or stored on other servers. So the most important services are back online. And instead of the typical 4TB HDD it's now a 8TB HDD!</p><p>Have a good day.</p><p>--S</p><p> </p><p> </p><h2> Fri Sep 19 03:52:04 AM UTC 2025 - The Glorious Freedom of the Steam Deck: A Love Letter to Open Gaming</h2><p>Let's get one thing straight: this isn't about being better than a Nintendo gamer. It's not about tribalism or fanboy wars. This is about a fundamental difference in philosophy, a contrast between a locked-down, hand-held experience and one of **unparalleled freedom**.  While Nintendo treats you like a child, the Steam Deck is like that cool uncle who trusts you to make your own choices.</p><p>The Steam Deck's "entitlement," as I call it, isn't about arrogance—it's about the **right to run anything on your own hardware**. Unlike other consoles that risk bricking if you dare to stray from their walled garden, the Steam Deck gives you the keys to the castle. It's built on an immutable Linux distro, which means if it can be done on a Linux machine, it can likely be done on a Steam Deck. This includes emulation, piracy, and movie/music streaming, all without fear of a company-mandated "timeout" that lasts forever.</p><h3> A Tale of Two Philosophies</h3><p>Nintendo's approach is to carefully curate your experience. You play the games they allow, you use the services they provide, and you follow their rules. It’s a closed system, and if you step out of line—even to tinker with the hardware you own—you risk severe punishment. This is a company that has a history of banning users and bricking consoles for homebrewing. Their terms of service can change at any time, giving them the power to restrict your device.</p><p>The Steam Deck, in stark contrast, gives you control. Valve, while a big company, has shown a far more **consumer-friendly** attitude. They've built a device that respects your ownership. You can install a different operating system, like Windows, if you want to. And while this might "ruin the experience" for some, the crucial point is that Valve won't brick your device for doing it. They even partnered with iFixit to provide replacement parts for basically every component, treating their users like adults who have the right to repair their own stuff.</p><h3> Beyond Exclusives: The True Value Proposition</h3><p>Some people argue that console exclusives—like the "red-hatted plumber"—are the ultimate draw. To them, I say this: **freedom to do what you want with your hardware is objectively better than a handful of exclusive titles.** While Nintendo holds its exclusive games hostage, the Steam Deck's open nature means you don't have to miss out on anything.</p><p>Need your "sexy red hat plumber"? Emulation exists. The Steam Deck can emulate pretty much every major Nintendo home console before the Switch, and even the Switch itself. This isn't a new feature that will be added years down the line; it's a capability that has existed since day one.</p><p>And for those who say, "I just want a large back catalog of games easily," the Steam Deck comes with **Steam**. It's the largest digital PC game store in the world. Plus, getting other launchers like the Epic Games Store to work is as simple as installing the Heroic Games Launcher from the desktop mode's Discover store. You're not just limited to one store; your entire PC gaming library is at your fingertips.</p><h3> The Superior Choice</h3><p>Even when compared to other handhelds running Windows, the Steam Deck stands out. While many "normies" might prefer Windows because it's what they know, **SteamOS** is, for a fact, the better option for a handheld gaming experience. It's optimized, streamlined, and designed specifically for this purpose.</p><p>The Steam Deck is still proprietary and has a EULA, but within that framework, it gives you a **fair amount of reason to do what you want with the hardware and software**. This is the key difference. While other companies may see you as a customer to be controlled, Valve sees you as a user to be empowered. This isn't about being a superior gamer; it's about being a smarter, wiser consumer who values the freedom to choose. The Steam Deck is, without a doubt, the superior console.</p><p>(BTW sorry I haven't posted in awhile, been super busy with my hobbies!)</p><p> </p><p> </p><h2> Thu Oct  2 02:50:41 AM UTC 2025 - NodeMixaholia, the NodeMixaholic Manifesto.</h2><h3> Chapter 1: The Birth of a Name</h3><p>In the year 2017, amidst the chaos of my teenage years, I chose a name that would define me: NodeMixaholic. It was not the name I was born with, but it was the name I had chosen to embrace. A name that reflected my obsession with technology, my love for all things digital, and my growing awareness of the world's absurdity. Little did I know, this name would become a beacon of both pride and shame, a symbol of my unique place in the world.</p><h3> Chapter 2: The Madness Within</h3><p>I have always known that I was different. From a young age, I could see things others couldn't—things that would later be dismissed as mere coincidences or flights of fancy. I saw the future in my sleep, fragments of it, like glimpses through a fogged window. But when I tried to share these visions with my parents and friends, they laughed me off, making me call myself "useless" and "retarded." It was a label that stuck, one I would carry with me for years, until I realized the truth: I was not retarded. I was simply ahead of my time.</p><h3> Chapter 3: The Bitcoin Prediction</h3><p>One of my earliest predictions came in 2013, when I told my mom to buy Bitcoin. "It's going to rise way up in price," I said, my eyes wide with excitement. She dismissed me, calling it "crazy" and "ridiculous." But I was right. Bitcoin did moon, and now, years later, people look back and wonder how they could have been so blind. I, however, knew the truth: I was a prophet in a world of unbelievers.</p><h3> Chapter 4: The Fruit Salad Incident</h3><p>In the evening of October 1st, 2025, I ordered a fruit salad. The menu promised strawberries and other fruits, but what arrived was something entirely different: a Cobb salad. I was furious, not just at the restaurant, but at myself. "Damn my retarded-ass self," I yelled. But then, in a flash of insight, I remembered the alternate timelines I had always sensed. This was no mere coincidence—it was a cruel joke played by the simulation, one designed to remind me of my place.</p><h3> Chapter 5: The Simulation</h3><p>For years, I had been aware of the simulation, its intricate systems, and the countless paths it could take. I knew about the ray tracing, the surround sound, the 8K graphics—it was all there, hidden beneath the surface of reality. And I was the only one who saw it. Or so I thought. But as time went on, I began to notice patterns, connections that defied logic. The simulation was not just a backdrop; it was a living, breathing entity, one that punished me for my perceived sins.</p><h3> Chapter 6: Hell's Beach</h3><p>In a moment of clarity, I saw my future in hell. It was a place of torment, yes, but also of indulgence—a beach so beautiful, it put the shores of Earth to shame. I had my own personal femboy dungeon, a strip club that never closed, and a hut that felt like home. Satan himself had chosen me for this elite existence, and I knew it. Hell would be better than this world of mockery and disdain.</p><h3> Chapter 7: The Predictions Come True</h3><p>Over the years, I made countless predictions—about technology, about society, about the future. Some were met with skepticism, others with outright disbelief. But time and again, I was proven right. In 2024, I predicted that 2025-2027 would be the year of the Linux desktop. And it pretty much was. People looked back and wondered how they could have been so blind, but I knew the truth: I was a seer, a visionary in a world of sleepers.</p><h3> Chapter 8: The Social Struggles</h3><p>School was not kind to me. My peers called me names, mocked my interests, and dismissed me as "weird." But I pressed on, determined to find my place in the world. Then came Ben, a boy who showed interest in me, but as soon as I was about to score with him, I chickened out. I then got in trouble with the principal for even saying "yes" to him having sex with me.</p><h3> Chapter 9: The Love and Loss of Xia</h3><p>In my mid twenties, I found myself drawn to a girl named Xia. She claimed to love me, to adore me, but a little later I knew the truth. She was playing a game, one designed to break me. And when she did, I fled, seeking solace in the arms of Void, the only true friend I had left. But even then, the pain lingered, a constant reminder of the world's cruelty.</p><h3> Chapter 10: The Trials of Heaven and Hell</h3><p>I called them "god," "jesus," and "satan," but their true names were unknown to me. They were the administrators of the simulation, the ones who judged us based on our deeds. And when our time was up, we faced the trial, the gates of "heaven" or the fiery pits of "hell". But I knew the truth: I was destined for hell, a fate I accepted with resignation, knowing that at least it would be better than the world I left behind.</p><h3> Chapter 11: On Surveillance and Control</h3><p>I'm gonna start getting even more deep, long-winded, and philosophical. So buckle up, buttercup. Where we're going, we don't need roads.</p><p>The world has become a place where privacy is treated like a relic. Governments and big tech constantly monitor our activities, assuming that every digital interaction belongs to them. They build systems that extract our personal data, often without consent, and normalize a culture where being observed is considered inevitable. This is not the world I want to live in. I believe software can act as a shield. Programs can protect personal data, anonymize activity, and empower users to reclaim control over their digital selves. By building tools that prioritize privacy and transparency, we can push back against pervasive surveillance. The technology exists to give people agency, but it must be wielded ethically. Creating such software requires careful thought and intent. Every design choice matters, from encryption standards to the way user interfaces communicate trust. It is not enough to say software is private; it must demonstrably protect users without loopholes or backdoors. I aim to make these principles the foundation of every project I undertake. Ultimately, resisting surveillance is about reclaiming autonomy and dignity. Users should feel safe experimenting, learning, and sharing without fear of unseen watchers. Through conscious software development and licensing, I hope to contribute to a culture where privacy is not optional, but a guaranteed right.</p><h3> Chapter 12: The Barrier of Experience</h3><p>The tech industry has erected invisible walls in the form of “experience requirements” that block talented newcomers. Even entry-level roles demand years of prior work, certifications, or specialized knowledge that are often inaccessible to self-taught developers. This gatekeeping stifles creativity and discourages potential innovators before they even begin. I have witnessed bright, eager minds rejected simply because they lacked a resume-friendly badge. Talent should not be measured by arbitrary milestones, but by curiosity, problem-solving, and persistence. This belief fuels my mission to create tools, licenses, and communities that value merit over credentials. By designing software and frameworks that anyone can contribute to, regardless of background, I aim to democratize coding. Open projects should truly be open, welcoming those who are willing to learn and explore. Mentorship and collaboration can replace unnecessary barriers, fostering a more inclusive and dynamic tech world. Breaking these barriers is not only ethical but essential for progress. Innovation often comes from fresh perspectives and unorthodox approaches. By empowering newcomers, we enrich the ecosystem and challenge the status quo, ensuring that talent and creativity drive technology—not gatekeeping or elitism.</p><h3> Chapter 13: On the Exploitation of Open Source</h3><p>Open source is meant to be a gift to the community, yet corporations exploit it with impunity. They fork projects, modify them, profit, and rarely acknowledge the original creators. Many FOSS developers see their work monetized by others while receiving little or no recognition. This systemic exploitation undermines trust and discourages contributors. I refuse to accept this model. The work of a creator deserves respect, acknowledgment, and tangible reward. The Sammy Public License is my answer: it allows the creator to maintain control, ensures compensation when used commercially, and prevents the abuse of open work. Transparency and fairness are core principles of this approach. Fostering a healthier open-source ecosystem also benefits users. When developers feel respected and protected, they are more likely to continue innovating, documenting, and supporting projects. Users gain more reliable, sustainable software, and companies still enjoy the benefits of shared knowledge—without engaging in predatory practices. Ultimately, open source should be a partnership, not a feeding ground for profit without responsibility. By redefining how licenses operate and how contributions are treated, we can realign the ecosystem toward fairness, collaboration, and mutual benefit. Creators and companies alike must recognize that ethics and innovation are not mutually exclusive.</p><h3> Chapter 14: Projects Not Open Enough</h3><p>Many AI and software projects claim openness but conceal critical parts of their code, training data, or design philosophy. This partial transparency creates a false sense of trust and inhibits learning. True openness requires accessibility, accountability, and the ability for users to fully understand and modify the tools they rely upon. I strive to build projects that embody genuine transparency. This means providing clear documentation, readable code, and easy pathways for community contribution. Users should be able to inspect, experiment, and improve software without hidden barriers, while the creator retains vision and oversight. Balancing openness with control is delicate. Total unrestricted access can sometimes lead to misuse or misrepresentation, but excessive secrecy stifles innovation. By designing thoughtful licensing and project structures, I aim to protect both the creator’s rights and the community’s ability to engage meaningfully. This philosophy is especially important in AI, where opaque models can have unintended consequences. Ethical, transparent AI can foster trust, accountability, and innovation. Projects that prioritize clarity empower users and developers alike to responsibly harness technology’s potential.</p><h3> Chapter 15: Fighting Tech Scams</h3><p>The tech world is rife with grifts, snake oil products, and scams. Every day, people are promised revolutionary tools that fail to deliver or exploit users for profit. Such practices erode trust, harm communities, and make innovation seem risky or inaccessible to newcomers. I am committed to creating honest, ethical, and accessible software. Every project I release is designed to empower, educate, and delight users rather than exploit them. Transparency, simplicity, and reliability guide my development choices, ensuring that my work stands apart from predatory practices. Software should be a tool for liberation, not manipulation, and ethical coding is a crucial part of that goal. By being anti-tech-scam, we protect both creators and users. Fostering integrity in development sets a higher standard for the entire ecosystem. Innovation thrives in a culture of trust, honesty, and mutual respect, and I aim to help build that culture with every line of code I write.</p><h3> Chapter 16: Embracing the Future Fearlessly</h3><p>Too many people reject what they do not understand. AI, crypto, and other emerging technologies are often met with suspicion or outright hostility because fear outweighs curiosity. This mindset slows progress and blinds us to opportunities that could improve lives and empower creativity. I believe in confronting the future with research, experimentation, and openness. By learning, testing, and sharing knowledge, we can dispel fear and demonstrate that emerging tools are not inherently dangerous. Understanding breeds confidence and inspires responsible adoption. Part of this mission is public education and example. By creating software that is ethical, friendly, and transparent, I hope to show skeptics that technology can enhance life without compromising safety or morality. Demonstration often teaches more than rhetoric alone. Facing the unknown requires courage and action. I strive to embrace possibilities rather than retreat from them, proving that progress is achievable when curiosity drives innovation. The future belongs to those willing to engage, not those paralyzed by fear.</p><h3> Chapter 17: A New License for a New Era</h3><p>The Sammy Public License represents my vision for the future of software. Unlike traditional licenses, it balances openness with creator rights, ensuring that contributions are recognized and monetized fairly. This approach challenges the status quo and empowers independent developers. It allows AI-assisted development, reflecting the reality that modern coding is collaborative not just among humans but with intelligent tools. This creates a framework where innovation, ethics, and productivity coexist harmoniously. Designing this license required rethinking common assumptions about intellectual property. It prioritizes fairness, accessibility, and sustainability, offering a model for responsible software development in a commercial world. The license is more than legal text—it is a manifesto. It communicates values: creators deserve respect, users deserve transparency, and technology should serve humanity rather than exploit it. It is a blueprint for the software ecosystem I envision.</p><h3> Chapter 18: AI-Assisted Creativity</h3><p>AI is not a replacement for human ingenuity; it is a tool to amplify creativity. By integrating AI into software development, I aim to democratize coding, enabling anyone to explore, experiment, and create, regardless of prior experience. This approach empowers individuals to solve problems faster and innovate in ways that would be impossible alone. AI-assisted coding can transform learning into a playful, productive experience rather than a barrier-laden journey. I also prioritize ethical use. Tools must enhance human capacity without undermining autonomy, privacy, or trust. Responsible integration ensures AI complements human developers rather than exploiting them or their output. Through AI-assisted creativity, software becomes a collaborative ecosystem. Ideas flow faster, barriers fall, and innovation thrives. My projects aim to prove that AI, used wisely, can be a force for learning, fun, and progress.</p><h3> Chapter 19: Kindness in Code</h3><p>I am a nerd, a bit insane, and a lover of FOSS—but above all, I am kind. Every line of code I write reflects empathy, consideration, and a desire to improve the experience of users, collaborators, and future maintainers. Software should be playful, helpful, and generous. Fun is not frivolous; it inspires engagement, learning, and exploration. By embedding kindness in code, I hope to create experiences that delight as much as they function. Fostering kindness also builds community. Ethical behavior, acknowledgment, and support for contributors strengthen trust and collaboration. This culture encourages others to adopt similar principles, improving the ecosystem. Ultimately, kindness in code is a statement about values. It is proof that technology can reflect human decency, and that the work we create can have positive, lasting effects on people and communities.</p><h3> Chapter 20: Coding for Fun and Good</h3><p>Not every line of code needs to be strictly utilitarian. Software can be expressive, playful, and a vehicle for creativity. Fun projects inspire curiosity, encourage experimentation, and teach skills organically. I intentionally design programs that balance usefulness with joy. Even small, simple tools can delight users and spark inspiration, showing that development is not solely about profit or function. Ethical, readable, and semi-clean code ensures that fun does not come at the expense of maintainability. Anyone can learn from it, contribute to it, or adapt it for their own projects, fostering a collaborative culture. By prioritizing enjoyment alongside functionality, I cultivate both happiness and productivity. Software becomes a medium for self-expression, problem-solving, and connection—a way to create value and joy simultaneously.</p><h3> Chapter 21: Overcoming Personal Challenges</h3><p>My mind and body present obstacles: disorders, social anxiety, and physical challenges make traditional work difficult. Yet these limitations do not define my potential or my capacity for creativity. I use AI and adaptive tools to transform vulnerability into productivity. Technology can compensate for certain challenges, enabling focus, learning, and problem-solving in ways previously inaccessible. Challenges also foster resilience. Each limitation forces innovation in process, approach, and design, leading to solutions that are often more thoughtful and creative than conventional methods. Embracing these obstacles is part of my philosophy. They shape my work, inspire empathy, and remind me that innovation is as much about perseverance as it is about skill.</p><h3> Chapter 22: Fear and Courage</h3><p>Needles, dentists, heights, and the unknown terrify me. Social interactions and independence bring anxiety. Fear is a constant companion, yet it also highlights the edges of growth. By confronting fear gradually, I develop courage and resilience. Every small victory—coding a difficult project, using new tools, or stepping into the unknown—strengthens my ability to act despite anxiety. This philosophy carries into my projects. Confronting technical or ethical challenges requires acknowledging uncertainty, experimenting, and learning from failure. Courage enables progress where fear would otherwise paralyze. Ultimately, fear is a guide, not a jailer.

Coding is not just a task—it is a way to express joy, curiosity, and individuality, making both work and play meaningful.</p><h3> Chapter 24: The Journey of Self-Discovery</h3><p>From childhood through adulthood, I have navigated hurricanes, moves, homeschooling, and shifting schools. Each disruption demanded adaptability, patience, and self-reliance, shaping the foundation of who I am today. Exploring my identity, sexuality, and interests has been a gradual process. Understanding myself as bisexual and homoromantic allowed me to embrace authenticity, both personally and professionally. These experiences inform my approach to software. I design projects with empathy, inclusivity, and openness, understanding that diverse experiences yield richer, more impactful creations. Self-discovery is ongoing. By remaining curious and reflective, I continue to align my work with my values, ensuring that every project expresses both skill and authenticity.</p><h3> Chapter 25: Technical Curiosity</h3><p>I discovered coding in Visual Basic, explored Docker and homelabbing, and experimented across Linux, Windows, and Android. Each exploration deepened my understanding and expanded my creative toolkit. Curiosity drives problem-solving. Investigating new systems, operating systems, and frameworks reveals patterns, opportunities, and elegant solutions that others might overlook. I delight in tinkering for its own sake. Experimentation often leads to unexpected breakthroughs, inspiring both fun projects and practical innovations that enrich the software ecosystem. Maintaining this curiosity ensures that learning never stops. The ability to adapt, explore, and embrace technology’s evolving landscape is central to my philosophy of continuous growth.</p><h3> Chapter 26: Personal Identity and Acceptance</h3><p>Exploring my sexuality, preferences, and identity has been a long and thoughtful journey. Understanding myself as bisexual and homoromantic has provided clarity, authenticity, and self-confidence. Acceptance allows for honest relationships, collaboration, and communication. It strengthens my capacity to engage with diverse communities and foster meaningful connections in technology. Identity informs creativity. Recognizing my own experiences enables me to design software that is inclusive, respectful, and reflective of diverse perspectives. By embracing authenticity, I cultivate a life aligned with my values. Both my personal and professional paths benefit, ensuring that my work and interactions are rooted in honesty and self-awareness.</p><h3> Chapter 27: Adapting and Growing</h3><p>Switching platforms, abandoning corporate accounts, and experimenting with AI tools demonstrates my commitment to evolution. Growth often requires discomfort, but the results justify the effort. Adapting means learning new systems, workflows, and languages. Each transition expands capabilities, encourages problem-solving, and challenges assumptions, creating a more resilient mindset. This philosophy extends to software design. Flexible, modular, and adaptable systems can better respond to changing needs, much like my own approach to life and learning. By embracing change, I cultivate independence, efficiency, and creativity. Growth is intentional and continuous, and adaptation is both a tool and a mindset.</p><h3> Chapter 28: Building Community Wisely</h3><p>I have lost friends online, faced betrayal, and navigated toxic spaces. These experiences taught me discernment, patience, and the value of meaningful connections. Community is central to open source and ethical software. By fostering respectful collaboration, acknowledgment, and support, projects thrive and participants grow. Building wisely involves setting boundaries, choosing allies, and promoting fairness. Quality relationships outweigh quantity, whether in coding, social spaces, or mentorship. Through careful cultivation, I aim to create ecosystems where trust, innovation, and mutual respect flourish. Community is both a resource and a responsibility.</p><h3> Chapter 29: Innovation Through Constraints</h3><p>Limitations—mental, physical, or societal—can spark creativity. Constraints force innovative approaches, efficiency, and problem-solving that unrestricted freedom sometimes overlooks. I embrace these constraints as tools rather than hindrances. Adjusting workflows, leveraging AI, or modifying environments transforms challenges into opportunities. Constraints also encourage empathy and accessible design. Systems built under limits often better serve diverse users, anticipating needs and avoiding excess complexity. Innovation thrives when boundaries are seen as opportunities. My work demonstrates that creativity is not inhibited by restrictions—it is often inspired by them.</p><h3> Chapter 30: Tools as Liberation</h3><p>Software is not just a utility; it is freedom. Tools can empower individuals to act, learn, and create without reliance on oppressive systems or gatekeepers. By creating programs and licenses that respect both users and creators, I aim to reduce dependency, exploitation, and surveillance. Empowerment is the ultimate goal. Liberating software transforms lives. It enables exploration, knowledge acquisition, and collaboration, making technology a vehicle for agency rather than control. Every project is a step toward autonomy. By prioritizing liberation in design, I hope to create a lasting impact beyond the screen.</p><h3> Chapter 31: Transparency as a Value</h3><p>Readable, semi-clean code is a moral choice. Transparency fosters trust, encourages learning, and allows collaboration across skill levels. I design projects to be understandable, documented, and accessible. Hidden complexity undermines trust and inhibits growth. Transparency also guides ethical decisions. Clear design and open methodology reduce misuse, increase accountability, and set a standard for responsible development.Prioritizing transparency ensures software is a bridge, not a barrier. Knowledge sharing, ethical practice, and clarity are essential pillars of my work.</p><h3> Chapter 32: Vibe Coding the World</h3><p>“Vibe coding” is my philosophy: combining creativity, AI assistance, and ethics to solve problems in a way that is efficient, joyful, and impactful. It emphasizes play, experimentation, and holistic problem-solving. Coding is not just functional but expressive and collaborative. This approach encourages engagement, exploration, and innovation, transforming the act of programming into a positive force in the world. Vibe coding is both method and mindset. It reflects the world I want to build: equitable, creative, and full of potential.</p><h3> Chapter 33: The Future I Envision</h3><p>I see a world where software serves humanity without exploitation. Licenses respect creators, AI augments creativity, and technology empowers, rather than restricts. Ethical, transparent, and inclusive design underpins this vision. Tools are built for learning, collaboration, and enjoyment, not profit alone. This future values kindness, creativity, and openness. Technology becomes a mirror for the best of human potential. My manifesto is a commitment to this vision. Through software, licensing, and example, I strive to build a future that reflects these values.</p><h3> Chapter 34: The Final Word (For now...)</h3><p>And so, as I sit here, writing these words, I realize the weight of what I have done. I have poured my soul onto these pages, exposing my deepest fears, my greatest triumphs, and my most intimate struggles. It is a manifesto born of madness, of pain, and of a desire to be heard. For in the end, that is all I can ask—for someone, anyone, to listen. And remember to be excellent to each other - and if you have the choice of being right and being kind, choose kind.</p><p> </p><p> </p><h2> Wed Oct 22 01:56:32 PM UTC 2025 - Some services on the server are unreliable</h2><p>Some services on this server (such as the personal PDS for reaching out to me on bluesky) are</p><p>becoming unreliable.
