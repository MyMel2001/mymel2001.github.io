It seems like it's either complete bullshit or it falls into the category of unfair advantages. </p><p>Imagine taking steroids for a sport. It's cheating, right? Well, biohacking feels a bit like that, but for coders. Taking pills and drugs to enhance your cognitive abilities feels like an unfair advantage.</p><h2> Unsafety Concerns</h2><p>Even if biohacking worked as advertised, it's still unsafe. There are potential side effects and long-term health risks associated with taking these substances.</p><p>I'm not convinced that biohacking is worth the risk.
