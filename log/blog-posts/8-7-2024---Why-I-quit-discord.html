While Discord's terms of service claim to prioritize users' </p><p>privacy, their actual policies have raised some red flags in my opinion. </p><p>As a vocal advocate for online freedom and security, I couldn't shake the </p><p>feeling that Discord wasn't doing enough to safeguard users' personal </p><p>information.</p><p>This issue became even more pressing when considering the sheer volume of </p><p>user data being collected by Discord. With millions of registered users </p><p>worldwide, it's staggering to think about the amount of sensitive </p><p>information that's being stored on their servers. The truth is, I'm not </p><p>convinced that Discord takes sufficient measures to protect this </p><p>information from prying eyes.</p><h2> Third-Party Clients and Modifications: A Threat to User Autonomy</h2><p>Another significant factor in my decision was Discord's restrictive </p><p>approach to third-party clients and modifications. As someone who values </p><p>user autonomy and the freedom to customize their online experience, I </p><p>found it disappointing that Discord wouldn't allow for more flexibility in </p><p>this regard.</p><p>Discord's stance on this issue has been consistent, but in my opinion, it </p><p>flies in the face of their supposed commitment to giving users control </p><p>over their own experiences. The inability to use third-party clients or </p><p>modify the Discord app to suit one's needs seems arbitrary and </p><p>restrictive.</p><h2> The Tencent Factor: A Concern for Government Surveillance</h2><p>Finally, let's address a rather contentious issue – the investment made by </p><p>Tencent, a Chinese technology conglomerate, in Discord. While I understand </p><p>that business partnerships are a natural part of any company's growth </p><p>strategy, this particular move has left me wondering about the potential </p><p>implications.</p><p>With the involvement of Tencent comes the very real possibility of </p><p>increased scrutiny from both Chinese and American government agencies. As </p><p>we know, governments on both sides have been increasingly interested in </p><p>monitoring online activity and tracking user behavior. Given this context, </p><p>I couldn't help but feel uneasy about the prospect of our data being </p><p>accessed by entities with less-than-ideal motivations.</p><h2> Conclusion</h2><p>In conclusion, while I appreciate the features and community that Discord </p><p>has to offer, my concerns regarding privacy, third-party clients, and </p><p>government involvement have led me to seek alternative platforms for </p><p>online communication. It's not a decision I've taken lightly, but one that </p><p>I feel necessary to protect my own digital freedom.</p><p>I hope that others will consider these issues as well and join me in </p><p>exploring other options for online community-building. Ultimately, our </p><p>online experiences should be guided by principles of user autonomy, data </p><p>protection, and transparency – values that Discord has yet to fully uphold.</p><p>However, a friendly reminder: you can add me on Session. </p><p>If you knew me on Discord you should know how to find me. If not, shoot me an </p><p>email to find out my Session ID via:</p><p>"discord.sucks(at)sllord(full stop)info". </p><p>Replace the "(at)" and "(full stop)" with a "@" and a "." respectively.</p></body></html>
